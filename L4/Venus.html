        <h1>Venus</h1>
        <article>
            Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.[12] It has the longest
            rotation period (243 days) of any planet in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most
            other planets (meaning the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east).[13] It does not have any
            natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the second-brightest
            natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of −4.6 – bright enough to
            cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.[14][15] Orbiting within
            Earth's orbit, Venus is an inferior planet and never appears to venture far from the Sun; its maximum
            angular distance from the Sun (elongation) is 47.8°.
            Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar
            size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other
            respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon
            dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the
            pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar
            System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the
            Sun.
