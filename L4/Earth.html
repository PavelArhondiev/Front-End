            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According

                gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural
                satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this
                time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.[n 5]
                Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.The
