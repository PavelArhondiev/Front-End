                            Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbital period around the     Sun of 87.97 days is the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the     Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.
Like     Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and never exceeds 28Â° away from the  Sun. When viewed from Earth, this proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western or e   astern horizon during the early evening or early morning. At this time it may appear as a bright star-like obje    ct, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete rang e of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which reoc curs over the so-called synodic period approximately every 116 days.

                            Mercury is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,[15] and rotates in a way  that is unique in the Solar System. As seen relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis  exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][16] As seen from the   Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only  once every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one day every    two years.
